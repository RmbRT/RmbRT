> The sign is a subtle joke. The shop is called "Sneed's Feed & Seed", where feed and seed both end in the sound "-eed", thus rhyming with the name of the owner, Sneed. The sign says that the shop was "Formerly Chuck's", implying that when Chuck owned the shop, it was called "Chuck's".

I am a great cryptocurrency and decentralisation enthusiast, and I believe in *the right thing* (as opposed to the subversive *worse is better*).
I currently work at [PolyCrypt GmbH](https://polycry.pt) as a core developer, working on our state channel framework [go-perun](https://github.com/perun-network/go-perun).
In my free time, I work on [my own programming language](https://github.com/RmbRT-lang), a novel consensus algorithm, as well as biblical essays.

I'm still a virgin (25) and looking for a wife, so if you're a biological woman aged below 30, hit me up.
